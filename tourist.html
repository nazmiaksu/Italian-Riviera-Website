        <h3>Duomo di Amalfi Cathedral</h3>
        <p>Amalfi Cathedral is a medieval Roman Catholic cathedral in the Piazza del Duomo, Amalfi, Italy. It is dedicated to the Apostle Saint Andrew whose relics are kept here. Formerly the archiepiscopal seat of the Diocese of Amalfi, it has been since 1986 that of the Diocese of Amalfi-Cava de' Tirreni. Begun in the 9th and 10th centuries, it has been added to and redecorated several times, overlaying Arab-Norman, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque elements, and finally a new 19th century Norman-Arab-Byzantine facade. The cathedral includes the adjoining 9th-century Basilica of the Crucifix. Leading from the basilica are steps into the Crypt of St. Andrew, where his relics can be found..</p>

        <h3>Praiano, Campania</h3>
        <p>Also along the Amalfi Coast, lies the town of Praiano (close to Positano), which is packed with beautiful beaches like Marina di Praia and Gavitella—and culture to boot. Come here for stunning ancient churches, towers, and sacred sculptures.</p>

        <h3>Ravello, Campania</h3>
        <p>Ravello, located high on a mountain three miles from the town of Amalfi, isn't just a pretty face—you'll find plenty of restaurants, cafes, museums, and charming villas galore. Don't forget to visit the 13th-century Villa Rufolo, which offers sublime views of the Amalfi coast, a garden that is forever in bloom, and a musical legacy (Wagner's time here in the 1800s has inspired an outdoor concert series that takes place every summer)</p>

      <h3>Vernazza After the Sunset</h3><br>

        <p>Vernazza, being one of the most scenic villages of the Cinque Terre is also one of the most photographed ones. This is the classic spot that offers the view of the whole town and the bay. The sun sets behind the distant hills which makes this location perfect for watching the sunset.

          After a hot and humid day of exploring the narrow streets of Vernazza and getting refreshed in the cool waters of the Ligurian Sea, there is nothing better than to watch the sun go down behind the distant hills. Especially if you have a view like this one, and even better to pair it with some local pasta and wine.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is a popular view point just next to one of the towers of Vernazza (of which there are 3!). The view is of the full length of the town with the Doria Castle in the middle, add some typical local vegetation in the foreground and of course the beautiful clouds with the golden globe of the setting sun and you’ll get a postcard perfect picture of one of the gems of the Cinque Terre.</p>
